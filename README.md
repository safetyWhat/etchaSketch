# etchaSketch

Goal provided by The Odin Project is to create a grid of squares 16 x 16 that change colors as you move the mouse cursor over the squares. The color change remains after you leave the square. This give the feeling of an Etch-a-Sketch in the fact that once a mark has been made it is permanent.

The grid is to be made with JavaScript not via copy/paste in HTML. Flexbox is to be used in the stylesheet to allow tbe boxes to resize so it will fit on any screen and fill the screen.

1. Create a container via html.
2. Use JS to create 16 rows of 16 squares. (For loop?)
3. Use CSS/Flexbox to make the box live to fit the screen.
4. Using CSS ensure no margins, borders, or padding are on the squares.
5. Create a "hover" effect via JS that causes the squares to change colors as the mouse cursor moves over the squares.
